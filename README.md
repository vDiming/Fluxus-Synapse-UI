# Installation
Simply download the exe simply from the github. Once done drag it into your Synapse X main directory make sure the "sxlibb.dll" file is also in your main Synapse X directory.

# Notes
For Support Join The Discord, sometimes when you first download it it will be buggy, but the support in the discord will help you find out what to do to fix the errors. (Trust me the ui works you just need to install it right)

I will probably be updating this ui sometimes soon if people enjoy it and it gets me discord members lol (server link at top)
